        <p><h3>About me</h3></p></br>
      <p>I am an aspiring web developer / software engineer. I am currently
      in my senior year at Lehigh University where I am studying electrical
      engineering and minoring in computer science. In my free time I love
      to play chess / board games and hike.</p></br>
      <p>
        I have been learning front-end web development in my spare time with
        freeCodeCamp since September 2017. This experience has been very exciting and
        I have picked up a lot of skills along the way, such as html, css, js,
        jquery, and bootstrap. This experience moved me to minor in computer science
        in my last semester at Lehigh. I am looking forward to learning more about
        creating software in the future.
      </p></br>
      <p>
        My goal is to ultimately obtain a job developing web applications.
