<li><strong>1881</strong> - Tsar Alexander II is assasinated. Berkman's uncle, Mark Natanson, is exiled for revolutionary activities. Berkman, influenced by growing radical sentiment, grows interested in some radical philosophies of the time, such as populism and nihilism.</li>
<li><strong>1882</strong> - He is influenced by the Nikolay Chernyshevsky novel, "What is to Be Done?" as a school student in Kovno, Lithuania. He joins a revolutionary literature group at school and is demoted for a year after distributing banned materials and espousing atheistic views.</li>

<li><strong>1888-1892</strong> - In New York, he becomes involved in revolutionary activities and contributes to several anarchist newspapers.

He becomes involved with Johann Most, an advocate for propaganda of the deed (violent acts carried out to incite a response from the masses)</li>
<li><strong>1892</strong> - He moves to Worcester, Massachusetts with Goldman and Modest Aronstam, his cousin, where they open a luncheonette. Berkman attempts and fails to assassinate Henry Clay Frick, an anti-union factory manager involved in the Homestead strikes in Pittsburgh.</li>
<li><strong>1892-1906</strong> - Berkman stands trial and is sentanced to 21 years in the Western Penitentiary and 1 year at the Allegheny County Workhouse. His appeals fail and he attempts to escape, which also fails. He writes <em>Prison Blossoms</em> with two other prisoners while incarcerated.  </li>

<li><strong>1911</strong> - Berkman helps to establish the Ferrer Center in New York, an alternative school (open to adults and children) based on Ferrer's Spanish school intended to educate from a non-traditional perspective. Emphasis was on students learning through interacting with the world, not staying behind a desk.</li>
<li><strong>1912</strong> - Berkman releases <em>Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist</em>, an account of his time in prison and one of his most well-known works.</li>
<li><strong>1917</strong> - The US enters World War I. Berkman and Goldman form the No Conscription League, an organization against the newly instated Selected Service Act, in NYC. They are arrested under the Espionage act of 1917 for trying to dissuade people from signing up for the draft.</li>

       <p>"If your object is to secure liberty, you must learn to do without authority and compulsion. If you intend to live in peace and harmony with your fellow-men, you and they should cultivate brotherhood and respect for each other. If you want to work together with them for your mutual benefit, you must practice cooperation. The social revolution means much more than the reorganization of conditions only: it means the establishment of new human values and social relationships, a changed attitude of man to man, as of one free and independent to his equal; it means a different spirit in individual and collective life, and that spirit cannot be born overnight. It is a spirit to be cultivated, to be nurtured and reared, as the most delicate flower is, for indeed it is the flower of a new and beautiful existence."</p>
      <p>
